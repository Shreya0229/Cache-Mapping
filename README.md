# Cache-Mapping
### About the program
A cache of size S with CL as the number of cache lines and block size B is to be built. S, CL, and B are in powers of 2. 
This is a program that allows loading into cache and searching cache using:
1) Direct mapping 
2) Associative memory
3) n-way set associative memory where n is a power of 2.
